# Testing
This repository is my first attempt at making something by myself without any guides. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose
----------------
The purpose of this repository/project, it for me to try making something for myself. 

## Language
----------------
Programed in C#
Though I am still not great at C# I want to make something for myself to test what I am capabale of, and what I need to improve at.

## For you
----------------
Though this is available to the public the purpose of this is not for others to inspect of be impressed. Sinse I am still unfamiliar with github I will keep this repository public as to not be restricted by github.
